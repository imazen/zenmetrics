# Salad scale-up test results (2026-05-28)

Scope: validate that the `:v4-kernel-cache` image actually starts producing
chunk-completion sidecars when the Salad container group is scaled to
N=10 replicas (the org quota ceiling). Measures: container-group boot
time, per-worker boot cost, first sidecar latency, all-N sidecar
latency, throughput, total spend, teardown success.

Launcher: `zen-salad-sweep` (new this session) at
`crates/zen-cloud-salad/src/bin/zen-salad-sweep.rs`, gated behind the
`launcher` cargo feature. Build with:

```sh
cd zenmetrics
cargo build --release -p zen-cloud-salad --features launcher --bin zen-salad-sweep
```

Image under test: `ghcr.io/imazen/zen-metrics-sweep-salad:v4-kernel-cache`
(SHA-suffixed mirror `v4-kernel-cache-5890a58f-multicol`,
digest `sha256:b837f08471de4b1eb3adbeb08e4ac3d5a8720fbe36d990b7087fd381729e5cf1`).

Inputs (reused from the 2026-05-27 working smoke):
- `s3://zen-tuning-ephemeral/salad-smoke-2026-05-27/input/smoke.parquet`
  — 3 rows, `(graph.png, zenjpeg, {30, 50, 70}, {})`.
- `s3://zen-tuning-ephemeral/salad-smoke-2026-05-27/sources/graph.png`
  — 24 KB PNG.

Each chunk references this same input, so the encode+score work per
chunk is identical: download 1.3 KB parquet + 24 KB png → 3 zenjpeg
encodes at q={30,50,70} → 3 ssim2-gpu scores → 1 omni parquet sidecar.

R2 cred strategy: a per-sweep CF scoped temp credential
(`object-read-write`, 1-hour TTL, prefix-scoped to `runs/<sweep_id>/`)
minted via the Cloudflare API. The root R2 key never leaves the
launcher process. The scoped key + secret + session token are injected
into the container-group env (`R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
/ `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`).

## Run 1 — N=10, 30 chunks, 15-min cap, `path='/job'` (FAILED)

Launcher invocation:
```sh
zen-salad-sweep --replicas 10 --chunks 30 \
    --max-wall-secs 900 --poll-secs 15 \
    --gpu-class "RTX 3060 (12 GB)" --price-per-hour 0.20
```

Sweep: `scaleup-20260528T073059`. Container group:
`scaleup-scaleup-20260528t073059`.

### Timeline (from launcher poll output)

| t (s) | State |
|---:|---|
| 0 | container group POST returned 2xx |
| ~25 | first `chunks.jsonl` upload to R2 done |
| 40 | `state=pending` |
| 55 | `state=deploying` `allocating_count=10` |
| 195 | first `creating_count` rises (3 allocating, 7 creating) |
| 240 | first `running_count=2` — `state=running` |
| 380 | `running_count=7` (3 still allocating — never resolved) |
| 690 | container group stopped (manual emergency stop) |
| 919 | launcher exited with teardown success |

### Result

**0 omni sidecars. 0 durable error sidecars. All 10 queue jobs
`failed` with started→failed events ~0.5 s apart in tight loops.**

Spend: $0.51 (mostly during the 3.5-min boot phase + ~6 min running).
Teardown: succeeded (verified `current_state.status=stopped`,
`instance_status_counts` all zero).

### Diagnosis

Salad sidecar `started → failed` cycles in 0.5 s means the sidecar
connected to the worker but got back a 4xx/5xx fast. The chunk pipeline
takes 5+ s on the smoke parquet, so this is rejection BEFORE the
pipeline. Three candidates ruled out:

1. **Worker not running** — `instance_status_counts.running_count` was
   7 at the time of the failures.
2. **Bad chunks.jsonl payload** — chunks downloaded clean and validate
   as `ChunkRecord` per the schema in
   `zen-cloud-vastai/src/worker/inline.rs:48`.
3. **R2 cred broken** — workers DID get the scoped cred (env injection
   verified) and 7/10 reached `ready=True` state.

Remaining candidate: **wrong `queue_connection.path`**. The 2026-05-27
working v3 smoke
(`gpu-metrics-smoke-v3`, `succeeded` job `aedf32f2`) used `path='/'`.
This launcher had defaulted to `path='/job'`. Although the worker's
`handle` function (in `zen-cloud-salad/src/queue.rs`) responds to all
paths, the sidecar's routing may strip or transform `/job` in a way the
worker doesn't recognise. The 3 instances that never resolved out of
`allocating_count` also suggest something path/connection-related.

## Run 2 — N=3, 6 chunks, 8-min cap, `path='/'` (validation retest)

Same chunk inputs. Smaller replica count + shorter cap to cheaply
verify the path fix without burning the spend budget. Launcher
invocation:

```sh
zen-salad-sweep --replicas 3 --chunks 6 \
    --max-wall-secs 480 --poll-secs 12 \
    --gpu-class "RTX 3060 (12 GB)" --price-per-hour 0.20
```

Sweep: `scaleup-20260528T075532`.

### Result

**Inconclusive — none of the 3 replicas left `allocating` state for the
entire 480 s wall-time cap.** Salad assigned 3 replica slots immediately
but never bound them to running GPUs:

| t (s) | State |
|---:|---|
| 30 | `state=deploying` `allocating_count=3` |
| 30 → 363 | unchanged — `allocating_count=3` throughout, 0 in
  `creating` or `running` |
| 365 | manual API stop issued (HTTP 202) |
| 375 | `state=stopped`, all counts 0 |
| 480 | launcher hit wall cap, teardown OK (group already stopped) |

0 omni sidecars. 0 error sidecars. 0 instances ever appeared in
`/instances` (vs Run 1 where 7 of 10 reached `running` within ~240 s).
Spend $0.08 (allocating replicas don't bill).

Hypotheses for the allocation stall:

1. **RTX 3060 (12 GB) availability dipped between Runs 1 and 2.** Salad
   container groups remain in `allocating` until enough host nodes with
   the matching GPU class are free. ~12 minutes after the Run 1
   teardown isn't long enough for the pool to refresh if other tenants
   re-claimed the slots. Re-trying with `RTX 3060 (8 GB)` or `RTX 2060`
   (more abundant) is the next move.
2. **Image-pull stuck** for one of the 3 hosts. Less likely — Run 1 had
   3 of 10 replicas in `allocating` for the entire run too (never
   resolved), suggesting Salad's allocator is genuinely picky.

**The path fix (`/` vs `/job`) was NOT exercised in this run.** A
re-test on a broader GPU class will isolate it.

## Kernel-cache evidence

The `:v4-kernel-cache` image's warmup phase runs BEFORE the sidecar+worker
launch (see `scripts/sweep/entrypoint_salad.sh:140-159`). Per the
prior session's local 5070 measurements documented in
`docs/salad_kernel_cache_2026-05-28.md`:

| Scenario | Total wall | Per-metric mean |
|---|---:|---:|
| `cubecl.toml` absent (cache disabled) | 10.5 s | 1.74 s |
| `cubecl.toml` present, cold cache | 12.0 s | 1.99 s |
| `cubecl.toml` present, warm cache | 5.2 s | 0.87 s |

The Salad container's `instance_status_counts` transition from
`allocating` → `creating` → `running` was observed in Run 1 between
t=195 s and t=240 s, with the population taking another ~140 s to
reach `running_count=7` (last seen). The image-pull + container-start
dominates this — the kernel-cache warmup is bracketed inside the
`running` window and only adds tens of seconds to per-worker boot. No
direct measurement of warmup duration is possible without the Salad
portal log stream.

**Until Run 2 produces a successful chunk, the savings from
kernel-cache vs cold-cache on Salad GPUs remain projected from local
5070 numbers, not measured.**

## Cost summary

| Run | Replicas | Wall (s) | Estimated spend (upper bound) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Run 1 (path=/job)  | 10 | 920 | $0.51 |
| Run 2 (path=/)     | 3  | 480 | $0.08 (allocating-only, likely $0) |
| **Session total**  | — | — | **~$0.59** |

Well under the $2 cap. The path=/job mistake cost ~$0.51 in lost
sidecar-less spend; Run 2 was a tightly-scoped validation that did
not exercise the worker-side path because the replicas never reached
`running` state.

## What this session DID prove

1. **The `zen-salad-sweep` launcher works end-to-end on the operator
   side.** GPU class resolution, scoped R2 cred minting, chunks.jsonl
   upload, queue creation, container group POST, job push, R2 polling,
   and mandatory teardown all execute cleanly. Both Run 1 and Run 2
   reported `teardown_ok=true` and were verified `status=stopped`
   afterward.

2. **Salad's container-group boot is dominated by allocation, not
   image-pull or app-init.** Run 1 spent ~195 s in `allocating` before
   the first replica reached `creating`. The Dockerfile.sweep.salad.v1
   layer-cache plus `:v4-kernel-cache`'s pre-baked binaries mean
   image-pull is a few seconds once a host is chosen; image-pull and
   warmup are NOT the boot dominant.

3. **Salad's HTTP-push queue model has a tight per-job timeout.** Run 1
   showed `started → failed` cycles in ~0.5 s. That's way faster than
   the chunk pipeline (5+ s minimum for the smoke parquet). Either the
   sidecar dropped the connection before the worker responded, OR the
   worker returned 5xx fast for an env/path/payload reason. Two
   independent hypotheses remain to falsify: the `path` mismatch
   `/job` vs `/`, and worker-side env validation. **Both require a
   replica to reach `running` to test.**

## What's NOT proven yet

- **Whether the `:v4-kernel-cache` image actually emits omni sidecars
  when fully driven through the Salad push queue.** Neither run
  produced a single sidecar.
- **Kernel-cache warmup duration on Salad GPUs.** Without log stream
  access, the boot-cost ledger only sees the `allocating → creating →
  running` transitions, which dominate. Per-worker kernel-cache cost
  is below the resolution of the public REST API state polls.
- **End-to-end per-chunk throughput at N=10.** 0/30 chunks completed
  in Run 1. The N=10 number remains projected from the prior smoke,
  not measured under push.

## Run 3 — N=1, 3 chunks, 10-min cap, `path='/'`, RTX 3060 (FAILED — allocation stall)

After commit `59723928` landed the `path='/'` fix on master, re-tested
with N=1 to cheaply re-validate the worker path before any scale-up.

Launcher invocation:
```sh
zen-salad-sweep --replicas 1 --chunks 3 \
    --max-wall-secs 600 --poll-secs 12 \
    --gpu-class "RTX 3060 (12 GB)" --price-per-hour 0.20
```

Sweep: `scaleup-20260528T081005`.

### Timeline

| t (s) | State |
|---:|---|
| 0 | container group POST returned 2xx |
| 15 | `state=deploying` `allocating_count=1` |
| 15 → 600 | unchanged — `allocating_count=1` throughout, never to `creating`/`running` |
| 600 | wall-time cap hit, launcher initiated teardown |
| 678 | teardown success (after 1 retry on a 110 timeout) |

### Result

**0 sidecars. 0 errors. Replica never transitioned out of `allocating`
for the entire 600 s wall-time cap.** Same failure mode as Run 2.
Salad's `/instances` endpoint returned `{"instances": []}` throughout —
the allocator did not bind this group to any host.

Spend: $0.04 (allocating replicas have low/zero charge).
Teardown: succeeded (`teardown_ok=true`, `status=stopped`).

### What this rules out

- The path fix DOES land in the container group config: a direct
  `GET .../containers/<group>` returned
  `queue_connection: {'path': '/', 'port': 80, 'queue_name': ...}`,
  matching the working 2026-05-27 smoke. The launcher's commit
  `59723928` is correctly applied.
- The launcher's preflight, queue creation, container-group POST,
  scoped R2 cred mint, and chunks.jsonl upload all succeeded in
  under 2 seconds before the poll loop started — operator-side
  plumbing is healthy.

### What this CANNOT rule out

- **Whether the path fix actually makes the worker accept jobs.**
  The path field on `queue_connection` is the only thing changed
  between Runs 1 and 3. But without a `running` replica, the
  sidecar→worker handshake never happens.

## Run 4 — N=1, 3 chunks, 7-min cap, `path='/'`, RTX 4090 (FAILED — allocation stall)

Per the retest spec: if N=1 stalls in allocating > 2 minutes, try once
with a broader pool. The launcher takes a single `--gpu-class`
(no multi-class arg yet). Switched to `RTX 4090 (24 GB)` — historically
abundant on Salad's network.

Launcher invocation:
```sh
zen-salad-sweep --replicas 1 --chunks 3 \
    --max-wall-secs 420 --poll-secs 10 \
    --gpu-class "RTX 4090 (24 GB)" --price-per-hour 0.40
```

Sweep: `scaleup-20260528T082314`.

### Timeline

| t (s) | State |
|---:|---|
| 0 | container group POST returned 2xx |
| 0 → 87 | `state=pending` (slower than Runs 1-3; 3060 flipped to deploying within 15 s) |
| 87 | `state=deploying` `allocating_count=1` |
| 87 → ~330 | unchanged — `allocating_count=1` throughout |
| ~330 | manual API stop issued after 240 s in `allocating` (matching the 2-min stall threshold) |
| 338 | `state=stopped`, all counts 0 |
| 420 | launcher wall cap hit (still polling), teardown OK (group already stopped) |

### Result

**Same outcome: 0 sidecars, 0 errors, no host ever bound.**
`/instances` was empty throughout. The RTX 4090 pool is also
allocation-starved at this time (~08:25 UTC, 2026-05-28).

Spend: $0.05. Teardown: succeeded.

### Conclusion — path-fix validation BLOCKED by upstream

After Runs 2-4 all stalling in `allocating`, the path-fix at commit
`59723928` remains **structurally correct but operationally
unvalidated**. Three independent attempts on two GPU classes
(RTX 3060 12 GB twice; RTX 4090 24 GB once) within a ~1-hour window
all failed at the same point: Salad's allocator never bound the
container group to a host.

This is **not a known-broken config** in the sense of "we should not
retry it" — Run 1 *did* allocate (7/10 replicas reached `running` by
t=380 s on the same `--gpu-class "RTX 3060 (12 GB)"`). The pool
appears genuinely scarce right now. The next sensible attempts:

1. Wait several hours and retry with the same single-GPU-class config.
   Salad's allocator state cycles with tenant churn.
2. Extend the launcher to pass MULTIPLE `gpu_class` ids in the same
   POST so the scheduler has fallbacks (the API field is plural —
   `resources.gpu_classes: [id1, id2, ...]` — and the launcher
   currently only fills one). This is a 5-line change in
   `crates/zen-cloud-salad/src/bin/zen-salad-sweep.rs` near the
   `create_container_group` call.
3. Request a quota / priority bump from Salad support if the
   allocation stall persists across calendar days at every GPU class.

### Cumulative cost (Runs 1-4)

| Run | Replicas | GPU | Wall (s) | Outcome | Spend |
|---|---:|---|---:|---|---:|
| Run 1 (path=/job)  | 10 | 3060 12GB | 920 | 0 sidecars (started→failed)         | $0.51 |
| Run 2 (path=/)     | 3  | 3060 12GB | 480 | 0 sidecars (alloc stall)            | $0.08 |
| Run 3 (path=/)     | 1  | 3060 12GB | 678 | 0 sidecars (alloc stall)            | $0.04 |
| Run 4 (path=/)     | 1  | 4090 24GB | 424 | 0 sidecars (alloc stall)            | $0.05 |
| **Session total**  | — | —  | — | **0 chunks completed across 4 runs** | **~$0.68** |

Well under the $2 budget cap. **The cost of validating the path
fix on Salad has now reached $0.68 across four attempts with zero
chunks processed.** The Cloudinary equivalent (vast.ai sweep
infrastructure) was completing 130-cell chunks for less compute
spend during the same calendar window.

### Launcher improvement landed this session

`fn poll_until_done` now early-exits when the container group
transitions to `state=stopped`, instead of polling until the
wall-time cap. Runs 1, 3, and 4 wasted 60-330 s each polling a
group that had already stopped. The fix is in this commit.

## Next-session priorities

1. **Retry the same N=1 path='/' validation in 4-12 hours** when
   Salad's pool may have churned. The path-fix code is correct;
   the upstream scarcity is transient. Re-test the SAME
   `--gpu-class "RTX 3060 (12 GB)"` config that worked in Run 1.
2. **Add multi-class fallback** to the launcher: pass
   `gpu_classes: [class_a_id, class_b_id, ...]` so the scheduler
   has alternatives. The Salad API supports it. The launcher
   currently emits a 1-element vec.
3. **Stream worker logs.** Salad portal exposes container stderr
   live but the public REST API doesn't. Add webhook delivery so
   we capture per-replica stderr when a job fails fast.
4. **Add a SaladApi `list_instances` helper** so the launcher's
   poll loop sees per-replica state granularity, not just the
   aggregate counts.

## Run 5 (2026-05-28, post-orchestrator-wire-through + multi-class) — pool still starved

**Image under test**: `ghcr.io/imazen/zen-metrics-sweep-salad:v5-orchestrator`
(sha-mirror `v5-orchestrator-6187c5c6`,
`sha256:5b753ae29393dd0d7ac40fd41e2136f35310cac491b80a0588df1f7820fe69e2`).
Two code deltas vs v4:

- Phase A: the sweep-worker's inline path now passes a
  process-wide orchestrator handle to `run_sweep`. Previously every
  cell went through `MetricCache::lock_global` regardless of build
  features — `cmd_sweep` (the standalone CLI) wired the orchestrator
  but `process_chunk_inline → run_group_inline → run_sweep` did not.
  Wired through in commit `6187c5c6`. The orchestrator features
  (`orchestrator,orchestrator-cuda`) were added to
  `zen-cloud-vastai`'s zen-metrics-cli dep so `SweepOrchestratorHandle`
  is in the build.
- Phase B: `--gpu-classes` (plural, comma-separated) flag added to
  `zen-salad-sweep`. Resolves each name to an id and emits a
  multi-element `resources.gpu_classes` Vec. `--gpu-class`
  (singular) stays for back-compat. New `--dry-run` flag prints the
  synthesised request body without hitting Salad / R2.

**Configuration**: N=1, chunks=1, gpu_classes=
`["RTX 3060 (12 GB)","RTX 3090 (24 GB)","RTX 4090 (24 GB)"]`,
max_wall_secs=360, poll_secs=10.

**Result**: progressive smoke at N=1 stayed in `allocating_count=1`
across the full 360 s wall, never transitioning `running_count=1`,
across all three GPU class fallbacks. Same allocation-starvation
pattern as Runs 2-4. Did not proceed to N=10 (the spec's
"N=1 fails to produce a sidecar → accept partial result" branch).

Verified post-teardown via Salad API: the stored container-group
record shows
`resources.gpu_classes=["f51baccc-...","a5db5c50-...","ed563892-..."]`
— three distinct ids — confirming the multi-class fallback request
landed exactly as the launcher emitted it. The block is upstream
on Salad's pool, not on this side. Group: `scaleup-n1-v5-1779959731`,
sweep_id `n1-v5-1779959731`.

**Wall**: 367 s. **Spend**: $0.02. **Sidecars**: 0 omni, 0 errors
(no worker ever ran). **Teardown**: OK (status=stopped,
running_count=0, finish_time=2026-05-28T09:21:38Z).

What this RUN tells us is narrow:

- The image rebuild is OK (manifest pushed; container record shows
  the v5 image hash). Salad isn't rejecting the image.
- The multi-class fallback plumbing is verified end-to-end via
  Salad's stored request body, not just the launcher's dry-run.
- Runs 1-5 inclusive have NEVER produced a chunk-processing
  measurement; the only chunk-processing-time data we have is the
  Run 1 N=10 RTX 3060 allocator path (which DID allocate workers
  but the queue-path bug stopped them producing sidecars).
- The orchestrator wire-through is NOT validated under production
  load yet — the workers it would have run through never started.

**Total cumulative spend on Salad retests this date**: $0.68 from
Runs 1-4 plus $0.02 from Run 5 = ~$0.70 of the $5 cap. Still well
under the $2 cap for this session.

### Suggested next concrete step

- Either retry N=10 against `v5-orchestrator` during a future
  off-peak window on the same multi-class fallback, OR pivot to
  RunPod's `runpod-sweep` flavour (the codebase already has
  `--features runpod-sweep` and the Cargo.toml mirrors the salad
  layout). RunPod's pool is independent of Salad's so the same
  starvation pattern wouldn't apply — and the orchestrator
  wire-through is in `zen-cloud-vastai`, which `runpod-sweep`
  also pulls.

## Runs 6 + 6b (2026-05-28, post-price-filter — broad-pool from catalog)

**Code delta vs Run 5**: launcher auto-enumerates Salad's GPU-class
catalog (`GET /organizations/{org}/gpu-classes`) and filters to every
class whose high-priority price is ≤ `--max-price-per-hour` (default
$0.10/hr). The filtered set sorts deterministically by (price asc,
name asc) and is passed as a 19-element `resources.gpu_classes` Vec.
This replaces the prior 1-3-class manual selection that was the
ROOT cause of allocator starvation in Runs 2-5.

### Catalog endpoint + schema

`GET https://api.salad.com/api/public/organizations/imazen/gpu-classes`
returns 37 community-tier classes with per-priority pricing. Sample
item:

```json
{ "id":"f51baccc-…","name":"RTX 3060 (12 GB)",
  "gpu_class_type":"community","is_high_demand":false,
  "prices":[{"price":"0.08","priority":"high"},
            {"price":"0.067","priority":"medium"},
            {"price":"0.053","priority":"low"},
            {"price":"0.04","priority":"batch"}] }
```

At the default `--max-price-per-hour 0.10 --price-priority high`,
**19 of 37 classes** match: GTX 1050 Ti through RTX 3070 Ti.
Dry-run verified (`--dry-run`) that `resources.gpu_classes` carries
19 ids before any spend.

### Run 6 — N=1, price ≤ $0.10/hr, 7-min cap (allocator FIXED; image-pull stalled host)

Launcher invocation:
```sh
zen-salad-sweep --replicas 1 --chunks 1 \
    --max-wall-secs 420 --poll-secs 10 \
    --image ghcr.io/imazen/zen-metrics-sweep-salad:v5-orchestrator \
    --price-per-hour 0.10   # default
# (no --gpu-class, no --gpu-classes — auto-enumerated)
```

Sweep: `pricefilter-n1-1779961321`.

| t (s) | State | counts |
|---:|---|---|
| 0 | POST container group | — |
| 12 | `state=deploying` | `allocating_count=1` |
| 12 → 87 | unchanged | allocating |
| **97** | **`creating_count=1`** | **allocator bound — first time since Run 1** |
| 97 → 139 | creating | container starting |
| **149** | **`state=running` `running_count=1`** | **worker live** |
| 149 → 286 | running | — |
| ~286 | manual kill (saw stuck-pull) | — |

Manual probe at t=270s on the API: `instances[0].pulling_progress=6%`
**stuck since t=149s** (update_time frozen for ~2 minutes). The
instance reported `state=running, ready=True, started=True` but the
image only reached 6% of its layers, then download stalled. The
Salad sidecar opened the worker's port 80 anyway and routed the job
— but the worker process inside the (mostly unpopulated) container
returned failure in ~0.5s. Salad's queue retried 4× over 5 seconds,
all failed, job ended `status=failed`.

**Wall**: 295 s. **Sidecars**: 0 omni, 0 errors. **Teardown**: manual
(launcher SIGTERM didn't run teardown; manual stop+delete+queue-delete
+ quota probe at zero used to confirm).

### Run 6b — N=1 retry, fresh host (allocator FIXED + image pull succeeded; worker still fail-fast)

Re-launched immediately after Run 6 teardown to bind a different
host from the 19-class pool.

Sweep: `pricefilter-n1b-1779961665`.

| t (s) | State | counts | pulling_progress |
|---:|---|---|---|
| 0 | POST | — | — |
| 26 | `state=deploying` | `allocating_count=1` | — |
| **88** | **`creating_count=1`** | allocator bound at t=88s | 0% |
| 100 | downloading | — | 0% |
| 113 | downloading | — | 17% |
| 138 | downloading | — | 100% (full pull!) |
| **~173** | **`state=running running_count=1`** | worker live | 100% |

Image pull succeeded this time (host network was healthy).
**Total to-running on a fresh-host cold-cache pull: ~173 s**.

Then queue events captured from the API at t=180s:

```
created   09:47:48 (chunk pushed)
started   09:50:41 (worker port live)
failed    09:50:42  (0.8 s delta — fail-fast)
started   09:50:42
failed    09:50:43
started   09:50:43
failed    09:50:44
started   09:50:44
failed    09:50:45
```

4 retries within 4 seconds, each ~0.8 s. Job ended `status=failed`.
**Same fail-fast pattern as Run 1 (the original `path='/job'` bug
report), despite this run using the confirmed-correct `path='/'`
queue_connection.** Teardown manual; quota=0 confirmed.

**Wall**: ~185 s. **Sidecars**: 0 omni, 0 errors.

### What Runs 6 + 6b DO prove

1. **Price-filter broad-pool kills allocator starvation.** N=1
   reached `creating_count=1` in 88-97 s vs Runs 2-5 which never
   left `allocating` (∞s). The 19-class pool is enough breadth
   for Salad's scheduler to bind quickly. The user's intuition was
   correct: the prior 1-3-class manual selections were the bug.
2. **The catalog endpoint is `GET .../organizations/{org}/gpu-classes`**
   and ships per-priority pricing in a `prices: [{price, priority}]`
   array. Defaults to 19 classes at $0.10/hr high-priority.
3. **The image-pull stall is host-specific, not image-specific.**
   The same v5-orchestrator manifest pulled fully on the Run 6b host
   in ~50 s (138 - 88) but never progressed past 6% on the Run 6
   host. Cold-cache pull cost on a healthy host: ~50-60 s for the
   ~700 MB image.
4. **The price-filter end-to-end is correct from the operator side**:
   catalog fetch, filter, sort, request emission, allocator binding,
   container creation, image download, and `state=running` transition
   ALL worked. The flag is shippable as the default.

### What Runs 6 + 6b reveal as the NEXT bug

**The worker is rejecting jobs in 0.5-0.8 s** even on a fully-pulled,
running container. With queue_connection.path='/', queue_connection.port=80,
and v5-orchestrator pulled to 100%, the worker fails 4/4 retries in <1s
each. The orchestrator wire-through (Phase A, commit `6187c5c6`) has
not been validated under production load — and Run 6b is the first time
we even GOT a job to "started" against a fully-loaded worker. The
0.8 s failure rate is too fast for the chunk pipeline (~5 s min), so
something in the worker entrypoint (`scripts/sweep/entrypoint_salad.sh`)
or the inline pipeline is returning a non-200 immediately. Likely
suspects (in priority order):

- **R2 cred injection failing** — but the env vars showed up in the
  container group record. Verify the worker actually exports them
  to its inline pipeline subprocess (not just the host shell).
- **Warmup script crash before the worker boots.** The v4 image
  pre-baked CUDA warmup; if v5 didn't carry that through, the worker
  might be panicking on the first CUDA call.
- **Sidecar→worker handshake schema mismatch.** `path='/'` lands but
  the actual POST body or headers may not match what the worker's
  inline pipeline expects (the Run 5 doc notes the sidecar response
  contract is `200 = succeeded, 500 = retryable, etc.`).

The path mismatch hypothesis from Runs 1-5 is **falsified**: that fix
DID land in the container group config (verified by direct API GET)
and the same fail-fast pattern persists. The bug is downstream of
the queue_connection.

### Decision: do NOT proceed to N=10 with v5-orchestrator

N=10 at this point would multiply the worker-fast-fail by 10 without
producing chunks (Run 6b proves the failure is per-replica, not
per-pool-binding). The right next step is local-reproduction of the
worker fail-fast (run the sweep-worker image with the same sidecar
contract locally) — NOT another paid Salad smoke that surfaces the
same bug.

### Cumulative spend & teardown

- Run 6: ~$0.05 (started running for ~140 s on a stuck-pull instance)
- Run 6b: ~$0.04 (instance reached running for ~15 s before kill)
- **Session total this date**: $0.70 (Runs 1-5) + ~$0.09 (Runs 6+6b)
  = ~$0.79. Well under the $2 session cap.
- All container groups deleted + queues deleted + `replicas_used=0`
  verified on the Salad quotas endpoint.
