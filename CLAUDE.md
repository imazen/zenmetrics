# zenmetrics CLAUDE.md

See global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md for general instructions.

## Canonical branch is `master` — NEVER push `main` (enforced)

This repo's one true branch is **`master`** (the GitHub default; the only branch
CI triggers on; where all history lives). There is **no `main` branch** — and a
GitHub ruleset (`no-main-branch`, id 18099751) **blocks creating `refs/heads/main`
server-side**, so a stray push to `main` is rejected, not silently merged.

Why this rule exists: the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` examples say `main`
(`jj new main@origin`, `jj bookmark set main`, `jj git push --bookmark main`). For
THIS repo that creates a stray `main` that diverges from `master` and orphans work
off the default branch. On 2026-06-25 `main` had accrued 7 commits that had to be
rebased back onto `master` and the branch killed. **Substitute `master` for `main`
in every jj/git command here:**

```
jj new master@origin -m "<task>"                       # start
jj bookmark set master -r @ && jj git push --bookmark master   # push
jj git fetch && jj rebase -d master@origin              # if push rejected
```

If `jj git push --bookmark main` is rejected by the ruleset, you followed the
global `main` example by reflex — re-point to `master`. Do not "fix" it by
disabling the ruleset.

## ghcr package names — ONE per artifact (enforced)

Before referencing or pushing any `ghcr.io/imazen/<name>` image: the canonical
package set is **`zenmetrics-sweep`, `zenfleet-worker`, `pycvvdp-scorer`,
`zen-train`** — and that's it. Variants (GPU build, provider flavor, generation,
commit pin, the shared base) are **TAGS** (`:exec-gpu`, `:hetzner`, `:v27`,
`:base-x86-cuda`, `:<sha>`), never new package names. The bake-everything base is
`zenfleet-worker:base-{x86,arm,x86-cuda}`, not a separate package. The source of truth is [`ghcr-packages.json`](ghcr-packages.json);
`just ghcr-check` (CI: `.github/workflows/ghcr-guard.yml`) fails if any infra file
uses a non-canonical name. To add a real new artifact, add it to the manifest in
the same change. Policy + the migration playbook for the existing splinters:
[`docs/GHCR_PACKAGES.md`](docs/GHCR_PACKAGES.md). `just ghcr-audit` diffs the live
org packages against the manifest.

## Fleet monitoring — actively flag idle/wasted infrastructure (standing rule)

Whenever a fleet is up (vast.ai / Hetzner / RunPod / Salad / basement), every box
costs money per hour. **Actively watch for idle/underutilized infrastructure the
whole time it runs — do not launch-and-forget, and report waste without being asked.**

- **Canonical detector: `zenfleet-core::idle`** (`crates/zenfleet-core/src/idle.rs`).
  A box past warmup is idle if: no heartbeat in 180s (frozen/dead) OR GPU ≤10% on a
  GPU box OR ≤1 job/hr (from `jobs_done/uptime`). A paid idle box burns
  `wasted_usd_per_hr`. **Every tool uses these same thresholds — do not invent new ones.**
- **There is ONE monitoring command: `scripts/jobsys/fleet`.** It replaced the old
  6-script sprawl (fleet_util_snapshot / fleet_status / watch_fleet / fleet_startup_watch /
  vast_cost_watch — all deleted). `fleet watch <run>` shows EVERYTHING in one place —
  boxes, $/hr burn, per-box GPU/CPU util, IDLE boxes, boxes that FAILED TO START within
  ~2 min (image-pull hang / onstart crash / fast-crash), and ledger/sidecar progress —
  and alerts (with `--destroy`, tears down) on idle / startup-failure / `--max-burn`.
  `fleet status <run>` = one-shot; `fleet top` = live ledger top; `fleet launch` / `fleet
  kill` wrap the launcher / teardown. `launch_fleet.sh` auto-spawns `fleet watch` in the bg.
- **Do NOT add another monitoring/launch/onstart script.** The guard `just fleet-check`
  (CI: `.github/workflows/fleet-guard.yml`) fails if a new `fleet_*` / `*_watch` /
  `launch_*` / `onstart_*` script appears outside the canonical set in `fleet-tools.json`.
  Add a subcommand to `fleet`, not a new script.
- **Canonical idle detector: `zenfleet-core::idle`** (`crates/zenfleet-core/src/idle.rs`) —
  past warmup: no heartbeat 180s, GPU ≤10%, or ≤1 job/hr. `fleet` mirrors these thresholds;
  the dashboard (`zenfleet-dash`) fires `FleetStalled` / `Underutilized` + shows util per worker.
- **On an idle / failed-to-start paid box: tear it down** and tell the user the $/hr saved.

## Data provenance — READ BEFORE TRAINING

**[`~/work/zen/DATA_PROVENANCE.md`](../DATA_PROVENANCE.md)** is the
canonical record of which R2 sidecars came from which codec commits.
Consult before training any picker / metric / regression on the
backfilled data — codecs like `jxl-encoder` shift RD curves between
commits, so mixing v22-produced and v23-produced JXL rows poisons the
fit. The doc records:

- R2 paths (input parquets, sidecars, encoded variants)
- Codec HEAD commit SHAs per backfill image (v22 / v23)
- Sidecar schema (column types + meanings)
- Reading recipes (pyarrow + s3fs)

Append a new section to that doc when you start a new backfill.

## CVVDP scoring on zensim training datasets (historical notes — NOT a binding pin)

**Status (corrected 2026-06-25 by the user): this is NOT a pinned/active task.** It is
past-Claude's notes, kept only for history — do NOT treat it as a hard constraint.
(The "PINNED" framing below misled a session into preserving dead scripts to "protect
the pinned task"; per the global rules, `@lilith`-attributed docs carry exactly the
reliability of AI output.) The bash `cvvdp_backfill/` flow + `v15/launch_gpu.sh` +
`onstart_v3.sh` this section references were DELETED in the 2026-06-25 fleet
consolidation; cvvdp now scores through the unified Rust worker (`onstart_unified` →
`zenfleet-sweep worker`) and `zenmetrics score-pairs --metric cvvdp`. Original ask
(verbatim, 2026-05-14, three messages):

> "we need cvvdp values for zensim development and all data sets it
> uses, we can use vastai dockerimages - but we should distonguish
> between different cvvdp implementations in col name"
> "parquet sidecars or however we do it"
> "enqueue this task so that a conpaction will not skip it, loop it"

### Requirements

1. **Compute CVVDP JOD scores** for every (ref, dist) pair zensim
   currently trains on. Inventory in
   `~/work/zen/zenanalyze/everything.md` — the "unified V_X store"
   at `/mnt/v/zen/zensim-training/2026-05-07/unified/` has
   2.37M rows × 7 codec/sweep parquets. Plus anchor sets:
   CID22, KADID-10k, TID2013, KonJND-1k.
2. **Distinguish implementations via column name** so multiple
   cvvdp variants land side-by-side without collision:
   - `cvvdp_pycvvdp_v054`  — canonical pycvvdp v0.5.4 reference
   - `cvvdp_gpu_imazen_<short_commit>` — our zenmetrics cvvdp-gpu
   - `cvvdp_burn_<short_commit>` — namespace reserved for a
     potential Burn-based port. Tick 324's spike (4.32× regression
     vs. the hand-written separable kernel at 4000×3000 on RTX 5070)
     ruled out the original Burn plan; the namespace stays free in
     case a future re-attempt wants to claim it. See
     `crates/cvvdp-gpu/docs/BURN_PORT_PLAN.md`'s "Status: ABANDONED"
     banner and `crates/burn-conv-spike/README.md`.
3. **Parquet sidecars**, matching zenmetrics' existing sweep
   convention (`image_path / codec / q / knob_tuple_json /
   <metric>_score / feat_*`).
4. **Compute infra: vast.ai docker images.** Reuse
   `Dockerfile.sweep.v26` (collapsed single-file image; replaced
   the v14→v25 chain on 2026-05-21) + `scripts/sweep/v15/launch_gpu.sh`
   + `scripts/sweep/onstart_v3.sh` per "Sweep runner discipline".
   pycvvdp installs ~3 GB of pytorch — its image must be separate
   from the cvvdp-gpu image to keep cold-start fetch under control.

### Progress markers (update each tick)

- [x] Inventory zensim parquet sidecars (paths, schemas, row counts):
      `/mnt/v/zen/zensim-training/2026-05-07/unified/` has 7 parquets,
      351 cols each, identity `(image_path, codec, q, knob_tuple_json)`,
      no cvvdp columns yet. 2.37M rows total.
- [x] cvvdp metric registered in `zenmetrics-cli` (it dispatches
      via `cvvdp_gpu::score` behind the `gpu-cvvdp` feature)
- [x] Versioned column name implemented (`cvvdp_gpu::CVVDP_COLUMN_NAME`,
      default `cvvdp_imazen_v<VER>`, `CVVDP_IMPL_TAG` env override).
      See commit b2b7f135.
- [x] Spec column schema (dtype, nullability, sidecar layout) —
      see `crates/cvvdp-gpu/docs/CVVDP_SIDECAR_SCHEMA.md`
- [x] pycvvdp scoring worker: `scripts/sweep/pycvvdp_worker.py`
      (consumes pairs TSV, writes parquet sidecar) +
      `scripts/sweep/Dockerfile.pycvvdp` (pytorch 2.5.1 + CUDA 12.4
      + pycvvdp 0.5.4). End-to-end verified locally on a synth pair
      (JOD 10.0 / 9.63 for identical vs chroma-shifted 64×64 inputs).
- [x] zenmetrics-cli `score-pairs` subcommand consumes the pairs
      TSV and writes parquet sidecars directly with the metric's
      versioned column name (cvvdp → `cvvdp_imazen_v<VER>`). The
      `Dockerfile.sweep.v26` image bakes `zenmetrics`, so the
      cvvdp-gpu scorer ships in that image with no new Dockerfile.
      Verified n=4 against pycvvdp on the same pairs: implementations
      agree within 0.03 JOD (q50–90, 64×64 noise images).
- [x] Encoder driver that re-encodes from
      `(image_path, codec, q, knob_tuple_json)` and emits the pairs
      TSV that the pycvvdp worker consumes:
      `zenmetrics-cli sweep --distorted-out-dir <DIR> --pairs-tsv <TSV>`
      (PNG fastest-effort dist images; deterministic filenames hashed
      on `(src_path, knob_json)`). End-to-end smoke-tested on a 2-image
      × 2-q grid: zenmetrics sweep → pycvvdp_worker score-pairs →
      4-row parquet sidecar with `cvvdp_pycvvdp_v054` column.
- [x] Per-chunk dual-implementation runner:
      `scripts/sweep/dual_impl_chunk.sh`. Drives one sweep + both
      scorers (cvvdp-gpu + pycvvdp) + a parity TSV side-by-side.
      Smoke-tested: 4/4 cells joinable, mean |diff| 0.0245 JOD,
      max 0.0300 JOD on the synth zenjpeg q50/q90 corpus.
- [/] Multi-instance dispatch (vast.ai fan-out wrapping
      `dual_impl_chunk.sh`) — chunk-claim from R2, run, upload
      sidecars back. Extends the existing v15 launcher rather than
      rebuilding from scratch. Chunk generator + worker + onstart +
      launcher all shipped (commits d2eb0f7c, 87deac34, 32a3b64a,
      c572c192). Push of corrected `zenmetrics-sweep:0.6.4-cvvdp-*`
      image still gated on a real-GPU smoke run (see 2026-05-15
      retry note below — local WSL2 can't satisfy the GATE).
- [/] Verification pass — local n=18 measured 2026-05-15 retry
      (decision D, q={30,70,90} × 6 zenwebp sources): cvvdp-gpu was
      forced through cubecl-cpu runtime (CUDA-in-snap-docker fails
      on this WSL2 host) where `atomic<f32>` panics short-circuit
      the kernel to default JOD=10.0, so the comparison reduces to
      "pycvvdp − 10.0" — mean |diff| 0.18, median 0.16, max 0.58.
      The parity number is unrepresentative of the gpu-cuda path
      and the GATE remains unverified.
- [ ] Production run + parquet write-back to
      `/mnt/v/zen/zensim-training/<date>/unified/`

### Local docker smoke 2026-05-15 — BUILT but NOT PUSHED

Built two images locally (canonical master HEAD aba984c context):

- `ghcr.io/imazen/pycvvdp-scorer:0.5.4` — sha256:e86bfb22aa82… (6.54 GB)
  - `pycvvdp-worker --help` works
  - End-to-end score-pairs CPU run on n=3 pairs: identical pair → JOD 10.000,
    cross pairs → 1.86 / 1.70. Image is functional.
- `ghcr.io/imazen/zenmetrics-sweep:0.6.4-aba984c` — sha256:30c2572f6891… (230 MB)
  - `zenmetrics --version` → `zenmetrics-cli 0.6.0`
  - `zenmetrics sweep ...` on n=6 sources × q={30,90}: 12/12 cells, no failures
  - `sweep --help` contains zenjpeg (Dockerfile RUN check passed at build)

**NOT PUSHED.** The `scripts/sweep/dual_impl_chunk_docker.sh` integration smoke
that the task's GATE was supposed to verify cannot run against the canonical-HEAD
v13 binary: `score-pairs` subcommand and `sweep --pairs-tsv` / `--distorted-out-dir`
flags live on `feat/cvvdp-gpu-scaffold` only (commit 14689621), NOT on canonical
master HEAD (aba984c). So the wrapper script's step 1 (`sweep --pairs-tsv …`)
exits with an unknown-flag error against the freshly-built 0.6.4-aba984c image,
and the parity GATE (mean |diff| < 0.10 JOD) is unverifiable.

Two paths to unblock:
1. Build the v13 image from the cvvdp branch instead (would require user override
   of decision (C) above), OR
2. Land the score-pairs / pairs-tsv subcommand on canonical master via a small
   targeted merge from feat/cvvdp-gpu-scaffold before rebuilding.

Secondary issue surfaced (local-env only, not a sweep design defect): snap docker
on this WSL2 box cannot bind-mount `/usr/lib/wsl/lib/libnvidia-ml.so.1` so
`--gpus all` fails with NVML ERROR_LIBRARY_NOT_FOUND. The pycvvdp CPU path still
works end-to-end; production vast.ai workers do not hit this.

### Local docker smoke 2026-05-15 (retry, decision D) — STILL NOT PUSHED

Picked up the unblock path 1 from the previous note: built v13 from the
`feat/cvvdp-gpu-scaffold` tree directly. New tag is
`ghcr.io/imazen/zenmetrics-sweep:0.6.4-cvvdp-76854e8` (the `-cvvdp-`
infix flags branch-origin to future readers).

Build-context approach: (b) materialised at
`/home/lilith/work/zen/_build-ctx-cvvdp-76854e8/` — rsynced scaffold
zenmetrics tree (excluding `target/`, `.jj/`, and the 6.7 GB
`scripts/cvvdp_goldens/`) plus trimmed `zenjpeg/` and `zenanalyze/`
siblings. Two builds were needed:

1. First build (canonical-features `--features sweep`, log
   `/tmp/build-rebuild.log`): produced an image with the scaffold's
   `score-pairs` subcommand and `sweep --pairs-tsv` flag (✓) but
   `cvvdp` disabled at runtime — `score-pairs --metric cvvdp` emits
   `metric 'cvvdp' is disabled (rebuild with --features gpu-cvvdp)`.
   This is the actual blocker the prior note missed: the Dockerfile
   never enabled GPU features, so even with the right subcommand
   shape, `score-pairs --metric cvvdp` cannot work against any
   image built straight off canonical's Dockerfile.sweep.v13.
2. Fixed by updating `Dockerfile.sweep.v13` to build with
   `--features sweep,gpu,gpu-cuda,gpu-cpu`. Second build (~5 min
   including 298 s LTO link) produced
   `sha256:d8786ca29428…` (576 MB, was 230 MB without GPU/cubecl).

`score-pairs --metric cvvdp` now reaches the cvvdp-gpu code, but on
this WSL2 box neither runtime path completes correctly:

- `--gpu-runtime cuda` panics at `cubecl-cuda runtime.rs:53` with
  `DriverError(CUDA_ERROR_OPERATING_SYSTEM)` even with libcuda.so.1
  + libnvidia-ml.so.1 bind-mounted at `/wsl-cuda/` and
  `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` set. Snap docker on WSL2 needs
  nvidia-container-toolkit, which isn't installed; task forbids
  fixing that.
- `--gpu-runtime cpu` (cubecl-cpu via tracel-mlir) hits
  `not yet implemented: This type is not implemented yet.
  atomic<f32>` in `cubecl-cpu compiler/visitor/elem.rs:38` once
  per pair. The score-pairs loop swallows the panic, writes
  `cvvdp = 10.0` as the default-fail value, and continues. Result
  is a parquet with all 18 rows at JOD 10.0 — kernel never
  executed.

Joinable n=18 (all 6 sources × q={30,70,90} mapped):
- `mean |diff| = 0.1805 JOD`
- `median |diff| = 0.1611 JOD`
- `max |diff|   = 0.5790 JOD`

GATE thresholds were `mean < 0.10` and `max < 0.30` — both miss.
But these numbers measure "pycvvdp − 10.0" because the imazen
column is the fall-through default, not the real cvvdp-gpu output.
The GATE remains unverifiable on this host.

Wrapper fixes shipped this tick (commit `f7e321b6`):

- `Dockerfile.sweep.v13`: `--features sweep,gpu,gpu-cuda,gpu-cpu`
  plus inline `score-pairs --help` / `list-metrics` sanity checks
  in the same RUN.
- `scripts/sweep/dual_impl_chunk_docker.sh`:
  - `--entrypoint /usr/local/bin/zenmetrics` for the zenmetrics
    image (prior wrapper assumed CMD — production entrypoint is
    `zenmetrics-worker`, which then expected R2 env vars).
  - `ZEN_GPU_RUNTIME` env var forwarded as `--gpu-runtime` to
    `score-pairs` for runtime override (defaults to letting the
    binary auto-detect).

What's still needed:

1. A real-GPU smoke run on a CUDA-capable host (vast.ai box or any
   non-snap, non-WSL2 box with nvidia-container-toolkit). With
   --gpus all and `--gpu-runtime cuda`, the n=18 parity should
   land in the < 0.10 JOD band (consistent with the n=4 sentinel
   that already passed at 0.03 JOD).
2. Push of both images is still gated on that real-GPU smoke.

### Blocker note

`crates/cvvdp-gpu/docs/CHROMA_DRIFT_INVESTIGATION.md` (0.117 JOD on
chroma_shift fixture, narrowed through tick 200) gates only the
`cvvdp_gpu_imazen_*` column. The `cvvdp_pycvvdp_v054` column can
ship now via `scripts/cvvdp_goldens/.venv`'s already-working pycvvdp
installation. Don't block the pycvvdp column on cvvdp-gpu parity.

### Loop integration

Every /loop tick should re-read this section and consider whether
the next concrete improvement should advance the PINNED TASK rather
than the next cvvdp-gpu kernel parity tick. If the pinned task has
forward progress available (a missing inventory, an unwritten spec,
an unbuilt Docker image) prefer it over yet another parity test.

## CANONICAL picker corpus + train/val/test split (read before ANY picker/sweep work)

**Full guide: [`docs/CLEAN_PICKER_PROGRAM.md`](docs/CLEAN_PICKER_PROGRAM.md).** Blind/forgetful
sessions: read it; do NOT invent a split or pick a corpus ad-hoc.

- **Split rule (one source of truth: [`scripts/picker/origin_split.py`](scripts/picker/origin_split.py)):**
  by ORIGIN image, last digit of the origin id — **{0,2,4,6,8}=train, {1,3,5}=validation, {7,9}=test**;
  every sizing/crop/encode derivative inherits the origin's bucket (nothing leaks). Deterministic, no
  seed. Train only ever sees even-origin content. Call `origin_split.split_of()` — never re-implement
  parity or use a seeded/random shuffle (the old `train_hybrid` per-rendition 20% shuffle was WRONG:
  per-rendition → scale leakage). `train_hybrid` now hard-errors if `origin_split` isn't on PYTHONPATH
  (add `scripts/picker`) — refuses a leaky fallback — and reports held-out **test** (7/9) alongside val.
- **Canonical corpus = imazen-26** (`/mnt/v/output/imazen-26-features/imazen26_manifest.tsv`, sha256-
  provenanced, 2157 origins → 1082 train / 657 val / 418 test, balanced across all 12 content classes).
  Segmented: `scripts/picker/segment_imazen26.py` → `imazen26_split_evenodd.tsv` + `imazen-26-split/{train,validate,test}/`.
  **dense-r6 is SUPERSEDED for clean training** (built from `K500_even` reps → train-biased, only 64 val
  + 48 test origins; `o_`=imazen-26, `v2_src`=imazen-26-png-v2).
- **Deliverables: clean even/odd pickers for jxl lossy + lossless, zenjpeg, zenavif** — sweep on
  segmented imazen-26 → train (origin split) → bake ZNPR → **commit the `.bin` into the codec crate**.
  Status table lives in `docs/CLEAN_PICKER_PROGRAM.md`. Verified on dense-r6: clean split holds the
  ≤1% top-3-verify (val 0.52% / TEST 0.42%, val→test +0.08pp — generalizes).

## PINNED PROGRAM — JXL lossy knob-space ablation (iterate to the picker shape)

**Status: active, multi-cycle. Survives compaction. Full plan:
[`docs/JXL_LOSSY_KNOBSPACE_ABLATION_PROGRAM.md`](docs/JXL_LOSSY_KNOBSPACE_ABLATION_PROGRAM.md).**

Goal: discover the **minimal knob shape** a JXL lossy picker should explore — which knobs +
*crosses* carry **content-dependent** RD value worth picking — and push everything else into
**code** (fixed default or feature-derived rule). Loop: design grid → fast Hetzner fleet sweep
(job system, per-cell, persist-everything to zentrain) → analyze (Pareto win-rate /
content-dependence / interaction, GBDT importance) → prune+pivot → **edit jxl crates to code the
settled knobs** → repeat until the grid stabilizes and the picker's achieved RD ≈ oracle. A knob
graduating swept→coded is a SUCCESS (shrinks codec + picker).

Decision rule per knob/cross: inert or universal → CODE; feature-deterministic → CODE RULE;
content-dependent + moves RD → PICKER axis; joint≠main-effects → keep the CROSS, else code the
main effects. Sweep ALL efforts **e1–e9 first** (each adds a real gate — incl. e9's lz77 +
enhanced_clustering — so we don't wrongly bury a knob that only pays off at e9; e10–12 only under
`--features butteraugli-loop`). Honor the byte-inert skip-list + the content-gate pinning gotcha
(see the doc). codec-corpus RO / zentrain RW. Carry CVVDP (cost-model never re-fit).

Every /loop tick: re-read the doc's "Current state / next action" and advance the next phase
(P0 main-effects → P1 crosses → P2 code-the-settled → P3 picker+oracle-gap) rather than drifting.

## burn: GPU-metric kernels ABANDONED ≠ training (separate binary, NOT a graph conflict)

Two *different* questions about burn live in this repo; don't conflate them:

1. **burn/cubek for GPU metric KERNELS** — ABANDONED (`burn-conv-spike`,
   `crates/cvvdp-gpu/docs/BURN_PORT_PLAN.md` "Status: ABANDONED", 4.32× slower
   than the hand-written separable stencil). The `cvvdp_burn_*` column namespace
   stays reserved but unused. Keep hand-written `#[cube]` kernels.

2. **burn for model TRAINING** — VIABLE and the chosen path. `burn-ranknet-spike`
   trains a RankNet/picker MLP via autodiff (custom pairwise + monotonicity loss
   → 0.998 pair-acc) — replacing `zensim-train-core`'s hand-rolled backprop.

**Architecture (decided 2026-06-09):** run metric scoring as separate binaries
that emit **parquet** sidecars; run training as a **separate standalone binary**
(burn + its own cubecl) that consumes those parquets and bakes ZNPR. They hand
off **data, not tensors** — so burn and the published **`zenforks-cubecl`** fork
**never share one cargo graph.** That coexistence problem is sidestepped by
construction. Do **NOT** add `burn` to this workspace's (zenforks-cubecl) member
graph: the rename `cubecl = { package = "zenforks-cubecl" }` can't reach burn's
own `cubecl-core` dep, `[patch]` can re-source but not rename, and the rename
exists precisely so our GPU crates can be *published* (patch is build-local). The
only thing that would force one graph is **differentiable metrics** (autodiff
*through* a zenforks kernel) — not on the table; revisit per
`crates/burn-ranknet-spike/README.md` if it ever is.

**Full ML-strategy write-up:** [`docs/ML_FRAMEWORK_AND_PICKER_ABLATION_2026-06-09.md`](docs/ML_FRAMEWORK_AND_PICKER_ABLATION_2026-06-09.md)
— the candle/burn/linfa 3-layer verdict, the GBDT teacher/GD-MLP-student framing +
measured model sizes (GBDT 975 KB / 109 KB gz vs ~27 KB ZNPR MLP), and the **picker
feature/knob ablation design** (conditional features×knobs×zq matrix; ablate inputs
by redundancy cluster, ablate outputs by RD-spread + content-dependence; GBDT as the
feature-selection instrument). Read it before scoping any picker.

## Local CUDA toolkit (for building/running GPU metrics)

The water-cooled 7950X workstation has CUDA 13.2.1 SDK installed at the
default location, but **nvcc is not on PATH by default**. CUDA layout:

    /usr/local/cuda            → /usr/local/cuda-13.2  (current symlink)
    /usr/local/cuda-13.2/bin/nvcc
    /usr/local/cuda-13.2/lib64/  (libcudart.so etc.)

Other versions also installed: 12.6, 13. Use `/usr/local/cuda` (the
symlink) unless you have a reason for a specific version.

To compile a `cargo` invocation that needs nvcc, prepend:

    PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

But note: **cubecl-cuda dynamically loads CUDA at runtime** via dlopen,
so building `--features sweep,gpu,gpu-cuda` succeeds even with nvcc off
PATH. The runtime fallback is sufficient for `zenmetrics` builds. Set
PATH explicitly only when shelling out to nvcc directly.

GPU info: `nvidia-smi` driver 596.21 / CUDA capability runtime 13.2.

## Sweep scheduling models — read BEFORE touching sweep features (CRITICAL)

This repo has TWO ways to execute sweep work; new sweep capabilities must land in BOTH
or explicitly document why not (2026-06-11: the --plan integration initially landed only
in chunk mode and had to be retrofitted):

1. **Chunk mode** — `zenmetrics sweep` (sweep/run.rs) + the vastai worker
   (`InlineGroupSpec`). Unit of retry = (image × grid-or-plan). For one-pass GPU-metric
   fleet runs.
2. **Job system** — zenfleet-core ledger + `zenmetrics jobexec` (the ZEN_EXEC executor).
   Per-cell content-addressed `DesiredJob`s; completion = declare → gap → re-reconcile.
   Built precisely because big sweeps (100k-cell AVIF) never finish in one pass. Entry:
   `--plan … --dry-run --emit-cells` → `zenfleet_ctl::declare_encodes`.

Plan-driven cells (ALL FIVE codecs: zenjpeg/zenavif/zenjxl/zenwebp/zenpng, verified
end-to-end 2026-06-11) flow through both with ONE identity (`{"cell","fp","plan"}` in
`knob_tuple_json` / `Encode.knobs`); the stratum id is self-describing
(`config_from_cell_id` / `variant_from_cell_id` per codec) and the fp is verified at
execute time. The vastai chunk fleet consumes plan cells as identity rows in plan-mode
input parquets (`generate_sweep_input.py --cells-jsonl`; the sweep runner's tuple path
routes them through `resolve_verified` — byte-identical to the Planned path, tested).
Contract + per-codec scalar-axis inventory: `docs/PLAN_SWEEPS.md`; job-system flow:
`docs/RUNNING_JOBS.md` §4b. Local-build note: the `zenjxl-decoder` workspace patch is
now a pinned git rev (0bd33d21, decoder main with `reject_progressive`) — zenjxl main
(b04ca75 onward; sibling checkout + CI pin now at 4c0d672f, the 2026-06-12 scalar-axes
landing) consumes that unreleased API; drop the patch when zenjxl-decoder 0.3.11
publishes AND zenjxl bumps its `jxl` dep (Cargo.toml patch comment). The 2026-06-12
scalar-axis landings (zenjpeg fff81900 / zenavif e9de3022 / zenjxl 4c0d672f / zenwebp
700aa4a8) extend the id grammars + fingerprints — declare/execute builds must pair at
those revs or newer (PLAN_SWEEPS.md §6 "Codec-rev pairing").

## Sweep build cheat sheet

- **Default CPU+GPU build (development)**:
  `cargo build --release -p zenmetrics-cli`
  → includes both `cpu-metrics` (default) and `sweep` codecs. ~2 min cold,
  seconds incremental.

- **GPU sweep build (production worker)**:
  `cargo build --release -p zenmetrics-cli --no-default-features --features sweep,png,gpu,gpu-cuda`
  → builds the GPU metric backends. **CORRECTION (audit 2026-06-25): this does NOT exclude
  cpu-metrics and is NOT a forced-GPU-only build.** `gpu` enables `gpu-zensim`, which pulls
  `cpu-metrics` transitively (`crates/zenmetrics-cli/Cargo.toml`: `gpu` → `gpu-zensim` →
  `cpu-metrics`), so the CPU butteraugli/zensim/ssim2 paths ARE compiled in and a chunk CAN fall
  back to CPU — the old "fail loudly / can't silently fall back" guarantee was false. To force-fail
  on CPU metrics you must first break the `gpu-zensim → cpu-metrics` dep in Cargo.toml; not possible
  via feature selection alone today. ~4 min cold.

- **WGPU variant (broader GPU compatibility, no CUDA SDK required)**:
  `cargo build --release -p zenmetrics-cli --no-default-features --features sweep,png,gpu,gpu-wgpu`
  → uses Vulkan/Metal/DX12 via wgpu. Use when targeting AMD/Intel GPUs
  on vast.ai. CUDA NVIDIA GPUs work but CUDA backend is faster.

- **CPU metric coverage — `cpu-metrics` is 4 of 6, NOT all six (the trap that cost a session 2026-06-26):**
  the default `cpu-metrics` bundle pulls CPU **butteraugli / zensim / ssim2 / dssim** only.
  **cvvdp and iwssim have in-tree SIMD CPU crates (`crates/cvvdp`, `crates/iwssim`) but are NOT in
  `cpu-metrics`** — reach them via `--features orchestrator,orchestrator-cpu-cvvdp` (resp.
  `orchestrator-cpu-iwssim`), which turn on `zenmetrics-api/cpu-cvvdp` so `zenmetrics-api::cpu_dispatch`
  (`Backend::Cpu`) holds a `cvvdp::Cvvdp`. So cvvdp/iwssim are **NOT "GPU-only"** — the README (lines
  16–36) states all six expose a CPU backend and `zenmetrics-orchestrator` has a *tested* no-GPU fallback
  ladder (`tests/no_gpu_fallback.rs`, `gpu.rs:32`) that selects `Backend::Cpu`. But that failover only
  reaches cvvdp/iwssim **if the build enabled their `cpu-*` feature.** A build with neither `gpu-cvvdp`
  nor `cpu-cvvdp` errors on `score-pairs --metric cvvdp` (`orchestrator_glue.rs:200`: "CPU variant of
  'cvvdp' is not available in this build; rebuild with --features …") — that error is a **build-config**
  message, not an architecture limit.
- **`score-pairs` bypasses the umbrella/failover for cvvdp when built with `gpu-cvvdp`:** it constructs a
  typed `cvvdp_gpu::CvvdpBatchScorer` (caches one `Cvvdp<R>` GPU instance across pairs to dodge the
  ~200 MB/NVRTC per-pair compile that OOMs fleet chunks — `Cargo.toml:91-93`) and calls it directly
  (`main.rs:2134`, `scored_via_cvvdp`), short-circuiting `run_metric()` — the umbrella `Metric::new` /
  `compute_srgb_u8` path that the orchestrator's `Backend` selection + CPU failover live behind. So on a
  `gpu-cvvdp` build cvvdp never consults the failover. To force CPU cvvdp: build WITHOUT `gpu-cvvdp`,
  WITH `orchestrator,orchestrator-cpu-cvvdp`.
- **Before claiming any metric is "GPU-only": `ls crates/` first.** `crates/cvvdp` + `crates/iwssim` are
  SIMD CPU ports; never infer architecture from a feature-gated build error (memory:
  `enumerate-repo-before-capability-claims`).

## Sweep runner discipline

- **GPU metrics only on production workers.** Mixing CPU/GPU scores
  across a sweep produces inconsistent training data — pickers/trainers
  expect a single metric backend. NOTE (corrected 2026-06-26): the GPU
  build does NOT force-fail to GPU (see the cheat-sheet correction above) —
  a chunk CAN fall back to CPU for metrics whose `cpu-*` feature is compiled.
  Keep a sweep on one backend by **selecting metrics whose backend you
  control** and verifying the score column's impl tag, not by assuming the
  build forbids CPU.
- **Pre-uploaded binary lives at**
  `s3://coefficient/binaries/zenmetrics-<version>-linux-x86_64`
  (R2 endpoint: `${R2_ACCOUNT_ID}.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`). Workers
  fetch via `SWEEP_BIN_OVERRIDE` env var.
- **Onstart script**: `scripts/sweep/onstart_unified.sh` — the ONE worker entry;
  execs `zenfleet-sweep worker --backend vastai --mode omni` (claim loop, adaptive
  concurrency, in-process scoring, arrow parquet IO — one process, all metrics). The
  legacy per-metric bash onstarts (onstart_v3/omni/cvvdp/iwssim/…) were deleted
  2026-06-25; `--mode feature-backfill` and `onstart_orchestrator.sh` cover the variants.
- **Every onstart MUST self-destroy on failure** — upload tail log to
  R2 + issue `vastai destroy instance ${CONTAINER_ID}`. See
  `scripts/sweep/CLAUDE.md#critical-every-onstart-must-self-destroy-on-failure`
  for the two acceptable patterns (image-level
  `run_with_error_trap.sh` wrapper — what `onstart_unified.sh` uses). Workers that exit without
  destroying burn \$/hr until externally cleaned up — that's the
  cost-leak the 2026-05-18 EXP-LARGER-LARGE incident chased.

## Heterogeneous SPLIT — encode-once (CPU) / score-many (GPU)

For multi-GPU-metric passes (butteraugli + cvvdp + ssim2-gpu + zensim-gpu),
encode once on cheap CPU and persist the variants, then score every GPU metric
over those persisted variants — never re-encode per metric.

- **CPU half**: `scripts/sweep/hetzner_cpu_sweep.sh` — sweeps with
  `--encoded-out-dir`, tars variants to R2 (the master record: 372 zensim
  features / diffmaps / future metrics re-derivable with no re-encode), and
  emits `pairs.tsv` (`image_path codec q knob_tuple_json ref_path dist_path`,
  in-container `/data/` paths).
- **GPU half**: `scripts/sweep/split_score_worker.sh` in
  `ghcr.io/imazen/zenmetrics-sweep:v29-split` (FROM the v29 GPU binary). Pulls
  variants+ref+pairs.tsv, runs `zenmetrics score-pairs --metric <m>` per GPU
  metric → one parquet sidecar each. Self-uploads its log to
  `sidecars/worker.log` and self-destroys on success.
- **vast quirk**: vast runs `--onstart-cmd`, NOT the image ENTRYPOINT — launch
  via `--onstart-cmd "bash /usr/local/bin/split_score_worker.sh > /var/log/split.log 2>&1"`.
  Pick a fast-net (`inet_down>300`) CUDA-matched (`cuda_max_good>=12.6`) offer;
  cheapest offers are slow-pull duds. Snap-docker here can't read `/tmp` — build
  SPLIT images from a `$HOME` context.

## Known Bugs

- **jxl `modes_full` memory — RESOLVED 2026-06-25; the "BufferPool leak" was a
  MISDIAGNOSIS.** There is NO per-cell / within-process leak. Measured on current
  HEAD (agent replication; `/tmp/repro_jxl_VERDICT.md`, `/tmp/repro_jxl_rss.tsv`):
  serial jxl `modes_full` RSS is a **sawtooth that returns to baseline between
  images** (per-image peaks ~11 GB @1.77 MP, ~22 GB @3.15 MP; valleys 1.5–2.7 GB),
  `--jobs 1` runs to completion with NO OOM, and heaptrack leaked **3.62 MB over
  55 cells** (a 60 MB/cell leak would be ~3.3 GB). jpeg stays flat <200 MB.
  `butteraugli::image::BufferPool` is a plain struct capped at 8 buffers
  (`image.rs:16,141`), owned inside a per-encode `ButteraugliReference`,
  constructed fresh in `butteraugli_refine_quant_field` and dropped on return —
  it does NOT persist across encode calls. The per-encode pool fix already landed
  in jxl-encoder `26a8d9cd` (#93) + a `MemoryBudget` guard.
  **A single jxl encode is SMALL (measured 2026-06-25, 3.15 MP, isolated via
  `jobexec`):** lossy VarDCT **0.20 GB**, lossless modular **1.50 GB**
  (thread-independent — same at 1 and 28 threads). NOTE on cell mix: raw
  `modes_full` is ~99% LOSSY (77,760 lossy strata across 10 axes + 630 lossless;
  156k cells/image unbudgeted) — it is the full Cartesian product, meant to be
  paired with `--plan-budget`/`--max-deviations`. A `--plan-budget` collapses the
  lossy cross hard: `--plan-budget 400` → 6 `_def` lossy modes + 315 modular (the
  earlier "96% modular" figure was this budgeted artifact, NOT raw modes_full).
  Neither raw nor budgeted modes_full is a good lossy-picker plan — see
  PLAN_SWEEPS / the lossy_dense recommendation (cross the high-value perceptual
  knobs: epf/gaborish/k_ac_quant/try_dct*/entropy_mul, ~360 strata × dense-q).
  **The OOM is the MONOLITHIC `zenmetrics sweep` accumulating across cells within
  ONE process** — `modes_full` on a single 3.15 MP image ramps RSS to ~13–24 GB
  across its 315 modular cells with NO per-cell release (allocator high-water, not
  a true leak), × parallel images on the box → the 31 GB OOM. The old
  "NOT thread-bound" datum fits: per-cell memory is fixed (1.5 GB); cells-in-one-
  process is the driver, not threads. **The job system bounds it by construction:
  one encode per FRESH process = ≤1.5 GB, freed on exit** — so `modes_full` runs
  fine via the job system, per-box concurrency ≈ box_RAM ÷ 1.5 GB (a 32 GB box ≈
  ~18 concurrent modular encodes). Do NOT use `rd_core` to dodge this — it's the
  crippled pre-ablated set (RD_ABLATION_2026-06-24.md); use `modes_full` via the
  **job system** (not the monolithic sweep). If the monolithic sweep must be used
  for jxl, bound image concurrency AND add a per-cell free / `malloc_trim` (the
  cross-cell within-process growth is a sweep-mode artifact, not a single-encode
  cost). Measurements: `/tmp/repro_jxl_VERDICT.md`, single-encode `/usr/bin/time -v`.

- **zenmetrics-api consolidated `it` suite self-poisons when run as ONE
  process** (observed 2026-06-10, pre-existing — A/B-identical 26-test failure
  set on master 7158c443 with and without the PuLumaGrayF32 change):
  `session_cap::allocator_cap_recycle_leak` caps the shared cubecl session
  allocator and later GPU tests in the same process inherit the poisoned
  client (panics at zenforks-cubecl-runtime client.rs:905). Same family as the
  ssim2-gpu one-process OOM below; workaround: run per-module/per-test
  processes. Lib + hdr unit tests and per-test runs are green.

- **ssim2-gpu consolidated `it` suite OOMs the 12 GB RTX 5070 when run as
  ONE process** (observed 2026-06-10, pre-existing at 704b19dd — NOT from
  the PU21 commit de2ced69; identical 61-test failure set on both). The
  42a107b1 test consolidation put all 98 GPU tests in one binary; cubecl's
  CUDA memory pool grows across tests and never returns pages, so
  `cargo test -p ssim2-gpu --features cuda,cubecl-types --release -- --test-threads=1`
  hits `CUDA_ERROR_OUT_OF_MEMORY` (PTX load) partway through, the server
  goes `ServerUnhealthy`, and every later kernel test cascade-fails. Onset
  point varies with ambient GPU pressure (54 vs 61 failures across runs).
  Every individual test passes in a fresh process (verified exhaustively,
  101/101 at e0995ae7 via per-module + batch-of-3 runs). Workarounds:
  filter to module groups (`--test it strip_parity::` etc.) in separate
  invocations. Proper fix candidates: per-module process isolation in CI
  invocations, a cubecl pool flush/shrink hook between tests, or capping
  concurrent pipeline allocations in the heavy 4096² tests. CI's
  macos-Metal job (8 GB unified) may hit the same wall.

## KADIS-700k zensim dataset (built 2026-06-30)

700,000 distorted-image cells — 140k KADIS pristine references × 1 `dist_type_1` × 5 severity
levels — each zensim-scored with its 372-D feature vector. **THIS crate ran the sweep** that
produced it: chunk-mode on a vast.ai fleet, pure-CPU config `METRICS=zensim` +
`ZENMETRICS_SWEEP_LEGACY=1` (disables the orchestrator cubecl warm-bench — the descriptor race
at `cubecl-runtime memory_manage.rs:418` is why GPU-metric sweeps fail on small cards) +
`ZENSIM_FEATURES_REGIME=with-iw` + `MAX_CHUNKS_PER_PROCESS=50`. ~91 cells/s/box, ~$0.7 total.
Three upstream bugs noted in `~/work/kadis-distort/benchmarks/pipeline_full_700k_2026-06-30.md`:
hardcoded `coefficient` claim bucket (`chunk.rs:63`); omni-skip gated on `!skip_claims`
(`chunk.rs:30`); orchestrator/cubecl init even when all metrics are CPU (`sweep_runner.rs:76`).
