## Reference version pin

`gfxdisp/ColorVideoVDP` **v0.5.4** (latest tag as of 2026-05-14).
Driver script in `scripts/cvvdp_goldens/` runs `pycvvdp==0.5.4` to
produce parity goldens. When bumping: also bump the R2 prefix
(`v1` → `v2`), the `GOLDEN_VERSION` const in `tests/common/mod.rs`,
and the version assertion in `tests/parity.rs`.

The cvvdp parameter JSON gets vendored into
`crates/cvvdp-gpu/data/cvvdp_v0.5.4.json` once the script lands (small
~5 KB file, safe to commit) and loaded through `params::CvvdpParams`.

## Out of scope (v0)

- Video / temporal channels (sustained + transient).
- Foveation / gaze maps.
- HDR display models — sRGB-std only for the initial parity pass.

## Open questions

- **Phase-uncertainty Gaussian blur** in masking. cvvdp applies a
  σ=3 separable Gaussian to the M_mm tensor when both band dims
  exceed `pu_padsize = 6`. The Rust port currently uses the no-blur
  path (`M * 10^mask_c`), which is exact for small bands but
  divergent on the larger coarse-level bands at standard_4k
  resolution. Port the blur once whole-image parity is being chased.

- **cvvdp bug: column-parity check in `gausspyr_reduce`.** Line 206
  of cvvdp v0.5.4's `lpyr_dec.gausspyr_reduce` checks
  `x.shape[-2] % 2` (row count) when deciding the right-column edge
  fix-up — the variable being patched is `y[...,:,-1]`, the
  rightmost column, so the parity check should clearly use
  `x.shape[-1] % 2` (column count). Doesn't affect the
  zenmetrics-corpus (all 2^k square inputs through the pyramid),
  but will cause a divergence on non-square inputs at odd-height-
  but-even-width levels. To preserve bit-stable parity our port
  reproduces the bug verbatim; document it here and re-evaluate when
  the cvvdp pin moves.

  Status: pure-symmetric-reflection happens to be equivalent to
  cvvdp's `zero-pad + explicit edge patches` for even-input dims, so
  `gausspyr_reduce_scalar` matches cvvdp exactly on the corpus's
  pyramid levels. `gausspyr_expand_scalar` now uses cvvdp's explicit
  edge-replication scheme (`interleave_zeros_and_pad`) so the
  constant-signal test passes across the whole buffer.
- **Per-band CSF weight precomputation**: should the host upload one
  flat `f32` array (`n_levels × N_CHANNELS`) or one tensor per band?
  Single flat upload is simpler; keep unless a per-band variant becomes
  necessary.
- **Atomics for pooling**: cubecl-cpu doesn't yet support
  `Atomic<f32>::fetch_add` (per zensim-gpu's lib.rs). Use per-band
  per-block partials with a tree reduction, same shape as zensim-gpu's
  fused features kernel, so the CPU runtime works.
